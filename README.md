*What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The main problem I tackled in this course was designing and implementing efficient data structures to manage and retrieve information effectively. Specifically, I worked on organizing course data in a way that ensured fast searching, structured storage, and minimal memory usage while maintaining scalability.

*How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by analyzing how the data needed to be accessed and selecting the most efficient data structure for the task. Since data structures determine how quickly and effectively information is stored and retrieved, I chose a Binary Search Tree (BST) to keep the course list in order while enabling quick lookups and insertions. This approach ensured that my program remained efficient and scalable when handling large amounts of data.

*How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

One significant roadblock I encountered was debugging file handling errors when reading data from a CSV file. At first, my program wasnâ€™t parsing the file correctly, leading to missing or misformatted data. I resolved this issue by implementing print statement debugging, refining my string parsing logic, and adding input validation to ensure the file was correctly processed before executing further operations. Another challenge was implementing BST traversal, which I solved by reviewing recursive logic and adjusting my approach to correctly display courses in alphabetical order.

*How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project reinforced the importance of planning before coding and structuring software for efficiency and maintainability. Instead of jumping straight into development, I first outlined problem requirements, selected the right data structure, and broke the program into modular functions. By doing this, I was able to create a more organized, scalable, and structured program that could handle a growing dataset while remaining easy to modify.

*How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Through this project, I improved my approach to writing clear, maintainable, and scalable code by focusing on modular design and documentation. Breaking the program into separate functions for loading data, searching, and displaying results made debugging and future modifications much easier. Additionally, I made a conscious effort to use clear naming conventions, add meaningful comments, and implement error handling, which improved the overall readability and adaptability of the code.
